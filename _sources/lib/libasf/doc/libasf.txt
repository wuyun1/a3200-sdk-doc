Introduction
============

The |libasf| is basically a customised and extended version of the Atmel Software Framework (ASF) library. 
The |libasf| contians the low level Board Support Package (BSP) that enables software development for the 
AVR32 processor and the GomSpace NanoMind A3200 board.

GomSpace has customised and extended the original ASF to include a number of 
usefull drivers and FreeRTOS enhancements for the AVR32 processor and the A3200 board.

Structure
=========
The |libasf| is structured as follows:
